My name is Jake O'Leary.

Currently I am in production on yuesmc.com, using this project as an opportunity to develop with the JAMstack and learn the API ecosystem.

I am learning Javascript, accessible HTML, CSS enhancements like SASS, deploying to CDNs, setting up authentication/auhthorization, configuring secure email services, and NoSQL databases.

Lately I have been working with the Next.js framework and learning how to put together development workflows and pipelines to production.

I have done work with Python libraries BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

I am currently studying "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship", 
and "Introduction TO Algorithms"
